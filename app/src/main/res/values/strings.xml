    <string name="upper">C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:</string>
    <string name="lower">\n1) C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.\n\n2) C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.\n\n3) C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.\n\n4) C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.\n\n5) C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.\n\nThere are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.</string>
